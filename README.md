Hi, I’m @GoldenFalls
I’m interested in fandom, AO3, CSS/skins, a11y and i18n
I’m currently learning piecemeal in my own time, which means my foundation is somewhat shaky but I have a lot of fun learning through trying things!
I’d be interested in collaborating on AO3 skins, but I don't have a ton of experience
How to reach me: you can try messaging me on Twitter @glowingfalls
